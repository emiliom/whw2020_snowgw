### Project Title
Snow groundwater interactions

### Collaborators on this project
Project lead: Nina Aragon

Data science lead: Emilio Mayorga

Science team: Jezra Beaulieu, Ravi Appana, Pranav Bhardwaj, Morgan Levy, Tony Castronova, Prajjwal Panday

### The problem
Several studies have shown that snowmelt is more effective at recharging groundwater stores than rain in mountain watersheds. The majority of snow-groundwater studies in snow-dominant mountain regions have been conducted at high elevation sites in CO. While snow-derived waters from these locations are vital to water supplies in the Western US, high elevation snowpacks are less at risk of disappearance due to increased temperatures associated with climate change. Warming temperatures associated with climate change have already caused significant declines in snowpack, and an increased fraction of the total precipitation falling as rain instead of snow. In particular, low-elevation snow in the mid latitudes of the PNW is projected to be at-risk of disappearing (falling as rain). 
 
### Application Example
This project could build tools that allow users to rapidly evaluate snow, and groundwater outputs from the National Water Model and identify regional variations in model performance. 

### Sample data
[USGS well data and stream gauge data](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis)

[NRCS SNOTELdata](https://www.wcc.nrcs.usda.gov/snow/)

[National Water Model output](http://thredds.hydroshare.org/thredds/catalog.html)

### Specific Aims
1. Characterize the relationship between precipitation phase (snow/rain) and groundwater recharge in two mountain watersheds, one in a continental snow climate, one in a maritime snow climate

2. Evaluate the ability of the National Water Model to capture snow and groundwater trends within our study watersheds by comparing model output to:

In-situ station data

Remotely sensed data  

3. Automate workflows so this analysis could be applied to any watershed in the CONUS. 

### Existing methods
Modeling, isotope analysis
